        <h3 style="">A Contemporary Example of Fecal Contamination </h3>
        <p>
            <p>According to the Philippine Department of Health (2019) in response to fecal contamination in the Manilla Bay,
                swimming in or drinking water polluted with fecal matter can lead to symptoms that include but are not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Diarrhea</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Cholera</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Typhoid</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Dysentery</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Various Skin Diseases</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Eye Infection</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If not treated quickly, the above symptoms can lead to more serious complications and death.</p>
            <p>One of the most prominent signs of fecal matter is the presence of coliform bacteria, a family of bacteria that are
                found in mamal’s fecies (Gale Environmental Encyclopedia, 2011) which “whether pathogenic or not, indicates that
                fecal contamination has occurred and that pathogens are likely present.”(Gale Environmental Encyclopedia, 2011).</p>
