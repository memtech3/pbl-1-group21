                <li>Define the Problem</li>
            <p>The problem we are trying to solve is the lack of safe drinking water. Our goal is to create a water filter that is
                capable of decreasing turbidity and removing contaminants.</p>
                <li>Do Background Research</li>
            <p>At this point in the process Micah found out about a type of water filter called the cyclone filter. The design of
                this filter is that it uses constant pressure and a cone shape to filter out contaminants and release a constant
                stream of water, no membrane needed. Though because of constraints, we might resort to a membrane filter.</p>
                <li>Specify the Requirements</li>
            <p>The requirements of this problem where to develop an inexpensive yet effective water filter to help remove harmful
                contaminants from drinking water sources.</p>
                <li>Brainstorm, Evaluate and Choose Solution</li>
            <p>We found an equation for the dimensions of a bradley hydrocyclone and Julian started working on cading them.</p>
            <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/iWZMua-6zVQI4wsM20VxYcIlcEocVrJd7eWRemByS3FalAoVlnsc4pH9d3dk4HTX-Tbp-l5XK-kF2FnWBv09zCEASkv8e3cxXzHeTi2WUePawtc7iRe_HL33NAYl7HPtV9keAPu5"
                    alt=""></p>
                <li>Develop and Prototype Solution</li>
            <p>During development, we realized that we were unable to develop a hydrocyclone within the deadline with the tools and
                knowledge that we had so we went back to the brainstorming phase and decided to create a filter with a yogurt cup,
                coffee filters, charcoal, sand and gravel, pulling loosely from the bio-sand filter’s design.</p>
                <li>Test Solution</li>
            <p>After testing the initial traditional filter design, we had to cut the yogurt container shorter and use less filter
                medium inside of the coffee filter in order to prevent the water from overflowing over the coffee filter and leaking
                sand into the “clean” water.</p>
                <li>Communicate Results</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The result of the traditional filter design was water that was quickly filtered and had a slight but distinct change
                in color.</p>

                Our group used sand, gravel, a coffee filter, a yogurt cup, cotten balls and charcol.
                
                Sand is good at removing pathogens by not only physically removing pathogens but by also using filtered materials to
                create a hostile environment for pathogens by forcing pathogens to compete for food, which ends up killing off most
                pathogens. (Pure Water for the World, 2013). Our group chose to use sand as it has been used effectively in the bio-sand
                filter design, which is known to filter out over 95% of most pathogens. **We are aware that we do not have enough sand
                to achieve a bio sand style filter but would like to use sand in an attempt to bring awareness to the biosand filter and
                use the basic principle of the biosand filter to make our water clearer.
                
                Gravel helps us separate the sand and the contaminants stuck in the sand from the other filter layers by allowing water
                to trickle through the gaps in between the pieces of gravel but making it more difficult for sand, and the contaminants
                trapped in the sand, to trickle through, resulting in cleaner, safer water. We chose to use gravel as it was also used
                in the biosand filter design to retain sand and contaminants.
                
                Activated charcoal helps remove contaminants from water by chemically binding with the contaminant to remove it from the
                water. I am not sure if the charcoal we received was activated, but if it was, it probably would have been much more
                effective.
                
                The final filter material was a coffee filter, which was used to help hold the loose filter materials togethor and keep
                the sand and gravel out of the water. Additionally, the coffee filter appeared to absorb a large amount of food coloring
                from the "dirty" water.
                
                To hold the coffee filter together, I used a yogurt cup that I cut down to ensure that the filter wasn't overfilled.
                
                After the water had been filtered, I used cotton balls in an attempt to soak up some of the food coloring to make the
                water clearer.
